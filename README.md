# Stock Analysis

# Overview of Project
The purpose of our analysis was to create a VBA script capable of analyzing a set of stock data. We wanted this script to be easy to use for our client. We ran our analysis using two VBA scripts, one that we created in our module and another that was refactored to enhance performance and accuracy. Having two scripts gives us a chance to compare the pros and cons of the codes.

# Results
